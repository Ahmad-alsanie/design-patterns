# Design patterns Made Simple
Real-World Design Patterns in Java. A comprehensive collection of most design patterns you need to know as a java developer.

## Description
A comprehensive repository dedicated to exploring classic design patterns through practical, real-world examples. This repository serves as an invaluable resource for developers who wish to deepen their understanding of design patterns and see how they're applied in everyday programming scenarios.

## How to navigate
Each package is created to host one pattern with a real-world example where there is also a `.md` file that describes each pattern and use case

## Table of Content
- [Creational](./src/main/java/creational)
- [Structural](./src/main/java/structural)
- [Behavioral](./src/main/java/behavioral)
- [Domain-Driven](./src/main/java/domain/driven)
- [Architectural](./src/main/java/architictural)
- [Integration](./src/main/java/integration)


## What You'll Find Here

- Practical Examples: Each design pattern is demonstrated with real-world use cases, making the theoretical concepts tangible and relatable.
- Wide Range of Patterns: From Creational to Structural, and Behavioral patterns, delve into a variety of patterns that address common software design challenges.
- Code Snippets: Easy-to-understand Java code examples that you can run, modify, and experiment with to grasp the nuances of each pattern.
- In-Depth Explanations: Alongside each example, you'll find detailed explanations that not only discuss how, but also why a particular pattern is used in a given context.
- Interactive Learning: Engage with the community by contributing your own examples, suggestions, and enhancements.


## Perfect For
- Software developers and architects looking to expand their toolkit with design patterns.
- Computer science students seeking real-world applications of theoretical concepts.
- Anyone curious about how design patterns solve everyday problems in software design.

## Contribute & Collaborate
This is an open-source initiative, and contributions are warmly welcomed. Whether it's refining the existing examples, adding new patterns, or improving documentation, your insights can help make this a richer resource for everyone.

Explore, learn, and create with design patterns that power real-world software!
