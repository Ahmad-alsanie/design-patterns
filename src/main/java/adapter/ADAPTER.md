## Adapter Design Pattern
The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. 

It acts as a bridge between two otherwise incompatible interfaces or classes. 

This pattern is particularly useful when you want to integrate new features or components into existing systems without changing the existing code.

### Scenario: 
Imagine you have an e-commerce application that initially processes payments using a `PayPalPaymentProcessor`. 

Over time, you decide to integrate a new payment service, `StripePaymentProcessor`, but it has a different interface. 

To avoid major changes in your existing codebase, you can use the Adapter Pattern.

### Our Use-Case
In our use-case, `StripeAdapter` adapts the `StripePaymentProcessor` to be compatible with the `PayPalPaymentProcessor` interface. 
This allows the e-commerce application to process payments through Stripe without altering the existing codebase that expects a `PayPalPaymentProcessor`. 
This kind of scenario is common in web development, especially when integrating various third-party services and APIs.
