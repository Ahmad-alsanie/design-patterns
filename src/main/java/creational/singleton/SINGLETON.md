## Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to this instance. 

It's commonly used in scenarios where a single object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, like in database connections, logging, file managers, and more.

### Characteristics
- Single Instance: a class has just one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- Lazy Initialization: Often, the instance is not created until it's needed for the first time, which is known as lazy initialization.
- Global Access: The instance of the singleton class can be accessed globally within the application.

### Scenario
Imagine you have a database connection pool manager. 

In many applications, it's beneficial to have a single instance of a connection pool manager to manage and reuse database connections efficiently. 

Using the Singleton pattern ensures that the same connection pool is used throughout the application, optimizing resource usage.

### Our use-case
- The `DatabaseConnectionPoolManager` class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
- The `Holder` class is a private static inner class that contains the instance of `DatabaseConnectionPoolManager`. The JVM defers the loading of the Holder class until it's actually used, which ensures that the singleton instance is created only when the getInstance method is called for the first time.
- This approach is both thread-safe and does not require synchronization.

### More about the HOLDER idiom
The Holder idiom, also known as the Initialization-on-demand Holder idiom, is a design pattern used in Java to create singletons in a thread-safe manner without the need for synchronization. 

It leverages the Java language's class loading mechanism and inner classes to achieve this.
