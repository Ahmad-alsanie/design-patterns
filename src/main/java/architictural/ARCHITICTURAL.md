## Architectural Pattern
Since these can be quite complex to model in real scenarios. I'll be focusing on just mentioning them with their basic definitions.

1- Model-View-Controller (MVC): separates the application logic from the user interface, allowing independent development, testing, and maintenance of each.
2- Microservices Architecture: structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.
3- Model View View Model(MVVM): is a software architectural pattern primarily used in building user interfaces. 
4- Serverless Architecture:  is an architectural approach in software development where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer.
